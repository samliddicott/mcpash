# Bash POSIX 6.11.2 core row probe
# Requirement: BPOSIX.CORE.025
# Feature: If the shell is interactive, Bash waits until the next prompt before printing the status of a background job that changes status or a foreground job that terminates due to a signal. Non-interactive shells print status messages after a foreground job completes.
